# Pacman
Pacman prototype in C

This is a project to college where we should recreate a game on Windows Terminal using only C language and, of course, the help of the conio.h library.
To play this game, you have to compile and execute it. Once it's being executed you can immediately start one round, change the theme or just visit your highscore (that one is being saved on a binary type archive).

:D
